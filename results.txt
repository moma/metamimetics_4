- Implementation of a small-world prototype, following the small-world network model from Netlogo
	RESULT: implementation works, rewiring coefficient changes the network from lattice to SWN to random network

- Implementation of the basic metamimetic dynamics in a SWN
	FILE: test_smallworld.nlogo
	RESULT:	high strength of dilemma -> diversity of populations (conf seems favoured), cooperation drifts towards ~50%
		low strength of dilemma, low inicoop -> some diversity of populations (mini seems heavily favoured), cooperation stays very low
		low strength of dilemma, high inicoop -> conformism heavily favoured, cooperation stays relatively high (at least ~75%)
		low strength of dilemma, medium inicoop -> conformism very favoured, cooperation stays around ~50%

- Porting of the code to Netlogo 5, using network library to speed up calculations

- Code moved to new file: emerge_topology.nlogo

- As of 24/04: emerge_topology, when set to initial conditions to work similarly as test_smallworld, gives us the following results:
		high strength of dilemma -> conf normally favoured, eventual domination of mini/maxi/combination of them - CHECK THIS!!!!
		low strength of dilemma, low inicoop -> some diversity of populations (mini seems heavily favoured), eventual domination of conf. Domination of mini seems more pronounced. Run OpenMOLE to confirm?
		low strength of dilemma, high inicoop -> behaviours seem more extreme, confs either explode or give way to mini/maxi.
		low strength of dilemma, medium inicoop -> same as above
CHECK IF ALTERATION ON CRITERIA FOR AM-I-THE-BEST HAS INFLUENCE
It seems so. Changing the criteria to the same as used before has normalized both files.

validation of emerge_topology to the results obtained at test_smallword: CHECK!

- First addition: ability to rewire. 
	RESULT: for very small LTR, even when in the most favourable condition for others (high SOD), conf dominates heavily. SWN emerges.
		for relatively small LTR (0.01), conf dominates. SWN emerges. Eventual domination of minis, with random network.
		for relatively high LTR (0.05), conf dominates heavily. SWN emerges. Eventual domination of minis, with random network.

- Next addition: transcription error. 
	RESULT: for very small TE (0.01), conditions above are the same.
		for medium TE (0.1), conditions above are the same.
		for high TE (0.5), we have random network.

- Next addition: replacement of agents.
	RESULT: With a medium TE, we get very low-grade SWN with vast conf domination. 

- Next addition: maturing period
	RESULT: run detailed openMOLE. It seems to make networks more unstable (favours maxi?).

- Next addition: random init
	RESULT: with a 0.01 ceiling for LTR, everything runs as expected. With a 0.05 ceiling for LTR, things get slightly more unstable (confirm with openMOLE?), but still conf-dominated and SWN-emerging.

- Next addition: weighting of history
