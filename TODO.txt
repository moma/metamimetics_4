- implement strategy and rule for each agent - CHECK
- implement PD playing - CHECK
- implement basic metamimetic framework - CHECK
- plot cooperation rate/fraction best - CHECK
- plot proportion of population for each rule - CHECK
- start looking at openMole for the near future - PENDING
- Introduce noise - HALF-CHECK
- Look at structuring of the network (Netlogo library) - CHECK (no need for netlogo library, but netlogo library is now being used on NL for calculating stuff)
- Endogenize propensity to rewire, weighting of history - CHECK
- use springs for visualization - CHECK
- introduce maturing period - HALF-CHECK?
- Introduce refreshing of agents - CHECK
- re-check algorithm (agents sad without neighbors with the same rule are not changing) - CHECK (problem with neighborhood)
- Implement visualization of scores -  CHECK
- Implement noise and tolerance to scores

- preferential rewiring (by distance) - CHECK
- selective pressure (index prob to die by cumulative payoff) - CHECK - REDO
- change score to average, giving no preference to bigger/smaller neighborhoods - CHECK

- selective pressure: two levels of strategy (genetic and cultural, genetic is initialization). When someone dies, make replicator dynamics on the neighbors (at genetic level) to decide the genetic level of the new agent
- average score to be calculated with an alpha-factor, where alpha is a discount factor which is the probability to survive - wouldn't it favour older agents?
